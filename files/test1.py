# replace values in <> brackets with the needed value and remove the brackets

# This is the first test you will take
# You will not be able to get help through the PyTon console, you will have to solve this on your own, but you can of course look at the last exercises
# The pattern is also different. You will get a few big exercises and you will solve them on your own

## test1.py

# 0) Write a program which prints out "<game1>, <game2>, <game3> are my favorite games" and let it read these 3 games out of list 'Fortbite', 'Mineslaft' and 'PyTon' (in this order)

# 2) Write a program which prints out the favorite numbers of Jack, Robert and Timon like this "The favorite numbers of my friends are <Jack's number>, <Robert's number> and <Timon's number>"
